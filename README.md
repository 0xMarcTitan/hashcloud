> This script sets up a cloud server automatically with Hashcat, Seclist and OpenCL drivers to enable hashcat to run on the cloud with minimal user set up. I have tested this on Vultr's hosting platform and evidence of this can be seen either on my blog or youtube. This version adds support for 4 different linux distributions. GPU support is mentioned in the code which will be added in a future release.

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/theirsecurity/hashcloud)

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/theirsecurity/hashcloud
```

## Usage

```sh
Identify the script that applies to your cloud server then use
chmod +x BASH_SCRIPT_NAME
./BASH_SCRIPT_NAME

This will bring up the help section

To set which linux distribution you will be installing on use one of the below

./hashcat.sh -o deb #This is for any debian based distros
./hashcat.sh -o fedora
./hashcat.sh -o arch
./hashcat.sh -o ubuntu 

Once this has run you need to copy over the hash file you want to use with hascat, i did this using SCP to the /root/hashes folder e.g
scp /INSERT_LOCAL_HASH_DIRECTORY CLOUD_USERNAME@CLOUD_IP:/hashes
```
