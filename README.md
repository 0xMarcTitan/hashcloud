> This script is an initial POC to set up a cloud server automatically with Hashcat, Seclist and OpenCL drivers to enable hashcat to run on the cloud with minimal user set up. I have tested this on Vultr's hosting platform and evidence of this can be seen either on my blog or youtube.

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/theirsecurity/hashcloud)

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/theirsecurity/hashcloud
```

## Usage

```sh
Identify the script that applies to your cloud server then use
chmod +x BASH_SCRIPT_NAME
./BASH_SCRIPT_NAME

Once this has run you need to copy over the hash file you want to use with hascat, i did this using SCP to the /root/hashes folder e.g
scp /INSERT_LOCAL_HASH_DIRECTORY CLOUD_USERNAME@CLOUD_IP:/hashes
```
